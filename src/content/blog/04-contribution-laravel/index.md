I'm thrilled to share that my contribution to the Laravel framework has been officially merged! ðŸŽ‰ This marks a significant milestone in my journey as a developer and an open-source enthusiast. Here's a brief overview of the problem I tackled, the solution I proposed, and why it matters.

## The Problem: Stuck Unique Job Locks

When using the `SerializesModels` trait with a `Unique Job` in Laravel, an edge case was causing problems. Specifically, if the model associated with a job was deleted before the job was processed, a `ModelNotFoundException` was thrown. While this behavior is expected and documented, the unique lock on the job was not released, causing it to remain stuck until expiration. This issue was particularly disruptive for delayed jobs and had been reported multiple times in related issues (#50211, #49890, and #37729).

## The Cause

The issue arose because the lock release mechanism required access to the job command instance. When a `ModelNotFoundException` occurred, this instance could not be unserialized, leaving the lock unreleased.

## My Solution: Contextual Hidden Data

To resolve this, I introduced a mechanism to wrap the job with hidden context, enabling access to the lock key and cache driver even in failure scenarios. Hereâ€™s a simplified flow:

1. Add hidden context with the necessary lock details before dispatching the job.
2. Upon handling the `ModelNotFoundException`, use the context data to forcibly release the unique lock.
3. Remove the hidden context after dispatching the job to avoid sharing it with other application components.

By leveraging Laravel's existing context capabilities, my solution maintained backward compatibility and adhered to Laravelâ€™s design principles.

## Steps for Reproducing the Issue

For those interested in replicating the problem, I included a detailed reproduction guide in the pull request. It involves:

1. Creating a test job with the `SerializesModels` and `ShouldBeUnique` traits.
2. Dispatching the job while holding a reference to a model.
3. Deleting the associated model before the job is processed.
4. Observing the behavior of the lock in the database (`cache_locks`) and the failed job log.

This helped confirm and clearly demonstrate the issue.

## Implementation Highlights

The implementation involved:
- Adding a test case.
- Modifying the lock release logic to account for hidden context data.
- Updating the `handleModelNotFound()` method to forcefully release the lock using the provided lock key and cache driver.
