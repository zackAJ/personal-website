In case you missed it few days ago (03/21/2025) <b>Next.js</b> was hit with major security vulnerability, here's fireship's video about it:

<iframe class="w-full" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AaCnBOqyvIM?si=TXGpIewUg1pqOX7h" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

> This news was covered widely and celebrated by <b>Next.js</b> haters including me.

After taking some time to look into this, I came to find out that the two security experts that were behind both shaming and saving Next.js were ... ü•Åü•Åü•Å <b>Algerians</b>.

## Who are they ?

### Rachid Allam (zhero_)

>Rachid Allam, 100% self-taught, web vulnerability researcher.

from: https://zhero-web-sec.github.io/whoami/

AKA <b>zhero_</b>, his <a href="https://hackerone.com/zhero_/hacktivity">hackerone.com profile</a> says it all.
He has hunted bugs in global apps that you use everyday (these are the public ones only):

### Yasser Allam (inzo_)

inzo_ seems to be the quite one, but his activity isn't very quite. The guy is an epic gamer on a roll.

These two seem to be yin and yang together (if they're not the same person xd) and they seem to be on a mission to hunt the JS echo-system, after this Next.js banger they also collaborated tackling <b>Remix.js</b> that lead to unpacking a vulnerability in <a href="https://zhero-web-sec.github.io/research-and-things/react-router-and-the-remixed-path" target="_blank"><b>React Router</b></a>

## The Algerian tech scene's neglect of open source contributions

Many questions to ask, why isn't this covered the Algerian tech scene ? What scene you might ask ? (right)

Weather we like to admit or not, tech for Algerians seems to be taken as a profession to put food on the table. It's rarely celebrated in the public scene here's 4 reasons why I think that is:

### 1. No north Star
Lack of dreams and ambition to be part of a bigger world: the internet is our portal.

### 2. It's just a job
Unfortunately most programmers, tech people and companies see this industry as a job nothing more, the passion is not there.
They also shame the person who codes in their free time.

### 3. The bubble
Most Algerian programmers speak two languages or more, but they waste that ability but staying in the local dev communities/companies without exposure to the bigger world.

### 4. Underestimating the impact
Most of us think it's a waste of time, we lack success stories from our own.

## To wrap up
I feel very proud and inspired by these two guys and I wish them more success to come in their bug bounty hunting and contributions.
I hope other Algerian developers will be inspired to tackle the world wide web and not just their localhosts.
