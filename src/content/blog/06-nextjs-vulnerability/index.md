In case you missed it, a few days ago (03/21/2025), <b>Next.js</b> was hit with a major security vulnerability. Here's Fireship‚Äôs video about it:

> This news was widely covered and even celebrated by <b>Next.js</b> haters, myself included

After looking into it a bit more, I found out that the two security experts who were behind both *shaming* and *saving* Next.js were... ü•Åü•Åü•Å <b>Algerians</b>.

## Who are they?

AKA <b>zhero_</b> , His <a href="https://hackerone.com/zhero_/hacktivity" target="_blank">HackerOne profile</a> speaks for itself.  
He has hunted bugs in global apps you probably use every day (these are just the public ones):

### Yasser Allam (inzo_)

Inzo_ seems to be the quiet one, but his activity is anything but quiet.  
The guy is an epic gamer on a roll.

These two seem to be yin and yang (unless they‚Äôre actually the same person, lol).  
After this Next.js banger, they also collaborated on tackling <b>Remix.js</b>, which led to uncovering a vulnerability in <a href="https://zhero-web-sec.github.io/research-and-things/react-router-and-the-remixed-path" target="_blank"><b>React Router</b></a>.

## The Algerian tech scene's neglect of open-source contributions

A question worth asking: why wasn‚Äôt this covered in the Algerian tech scene?  
What scene, you ask? (Exactly.)

Whether we like to admit it or not, tech in Algeria is mostly treated as a profession to put food on the table. It‚Äôs rarely celebrated in the public space. Here are 4 reasons why I think that is:

### 1. No north Star  
There‚Äôs a lack of ambition to be part of something bigger. The internet is our portal to a world of possibilities and exposures.

### 2. It‚Äôs just a job  
Most programmers, tech people, and companies treat this industry like a 9-to-5. Passion is rare.  
Worse, people often mock those who code in their free time.

### 3. The bubble  
Many Algerian devs speak two or more languages, yet they stay confined to local communities and companies‚Äîdisconnected from the global tech world.

### 4. Underestimating the impact  
We think open source is a waste of time. We don‚Äôt see local success stories, so we don‚Äôt believe in them.

## To wrap up
I feel very proud and inspired by these two guys and I wish them more success to come in their bug bounty hunting and contributions.
I hope other Algerian developers will aspire to tackle the world wide web and not just their localhosts.

>Next.js and React suck btw.
